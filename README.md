election-tweets
===============

This app was developed to recollect tweets related to the municipal and
deputies elections in Cozumel.

Due to there was not a solid criteria to search or filters in common, the
tweets were introduced manually.

This application uses [GET statuses/oembed](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/oembed) from twitter's REST API 1.1
and is powered by [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
